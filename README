Requirements:
 apache, php 5, curl


What:
	Feature List:
		- scour sites for proxies
		- multi-threaded proxy testing
		- multi-threaded proxy anonymity checking (internal or external check)
		- output proxies in certain formats
		- banned list
		- scour sites for new codeen/planet proxies list
		- db maintenance section

		
How:
	Select your mode:
	- search
	- test
	- output
	- banned
	- database
	- help

	search - select which sites you want to scour for proxies and configure the output once the list is complete
		 - you can save the list into the database to be checked later
		 - you can output the list as plaintext or csv
		 - you can choose which sites you want to search for proxies
		 - select mysql as the option in order to check proxy status

	test   - select which proxies you want to test
		 - you can test new proxies entered from the previous search
		 - you can test good proxies to make sure they are still good
		 - you can test inactive proxies to see if they might be up
		 - you can test the anonymity level of proxies after they are known to be good
		 - if a new proxy scoured never works once, it is deleted from the database
		 - if a good or anonymous proxy is down, it is put into the inactive table
		 - if an inactive proxy is tested and is still down, it stays in the inactive table
		 - if an inactive proxy is tested and is up it is put into the good table
		 - there are over 9000 new, good, and inactive proxies allowed per check by default

	output - select how you want your final list format
		 - you can output anonymous proxies, good, new, inactive, or banned proxies
		 - you can output the proxy list as plaintext, csv, or as proxychains format: example - (socks4 192.168.1.49 1080)

	banned - scour sites for new codeen/planet proxies to ban
		 - you can save the output to mysql in the banned table
		 - you can output as a plaintext list
		 - you can choose which sites you want to search for new codeen/planet proxies
	
	database - perform simple maintenance on the database
		 - you can select both the new + good table, new, good, inactive, or banned table
		 - you can eliminate duplicates, or truncate table
	help   - very simple in program help menu
	
	setup  - there is no update from v0.2 -> v0.3. completely remove all tables and data as the table structure has changed
		   - delete entire proxybot directory and load new directory in its place; files have been changed, added, and removed
		   - all database info is inside of config.inc.php; edit this file depending on your database setup
		   - all other configuration for proxybot is in config.php; change depending on host settings
		   - set ALLOW_TRUNCATE to 1 in config.php if you want to allow deleting of tables; not a good idea on a live site
		   - free host disclaimer:
			  proxybot does not work on free hosts for the following reasons:
				1. most free hosts have a very low default timeout; the script needs time to scour and to check
				2. lowering the number of proxies to check does not really help on free hosts; the checking feature does not work at all
				3. CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION + php + open_basedir or safe_mode = fuckup
					see: http://us.php.net/manual/ro/function.curl-setopt.php#71313 for workaround; don't bother, it still failed us
				4. free hosts most likely have a max number of curl requests and proxybot surely exceeds it
			
				
Why:
	Why did I include a gnu gpl?  As the level of sophistication of this program grew to rival that of commercial software out there, 
	I realized the necessity of a license; to prevent this code from ever being anything but 100% open source, and 100% public domain.
